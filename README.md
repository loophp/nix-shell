# Nix shell

![Tutorial](./docs/readme.gif "Tutorial")

## Description

This package provides a `Nix flake` ready to use
for PHP development, using the [`Nix` package manager][50]
which can be installed on (_almost_) any operating system.

Each available environment provides the following tools:

- Composer,
- Symfony CLI,
- SQLite

Available stable PHP versions from `5.6` to `8.3`. But also weekly builds from
the following branches:

- `PHP-8.1`
- `PHP-8.2`
- `PHP-8.3`
- `master` (*future 8.4*)

To list the available PHP versions, run:

```shell
nix flake show github:loophp/nix-shell
```

The PHP extensions to use are automatically inferred from the `composer.json`
file.

```json
...8<...

"require": {
  "ext-intl": "*",
},
"require-dev": {
  "ext-xdebug": "*",
  "ext-pcov": "*",
}

...>8...
```

To load extensions from the `require` and `required-dev` sections, using the flag
`--impure` is required. Example:

```shell
nix shell github:loophp/nix-shell#php82 --impure
```

We use [Cachix](https://app.cachix.org/cache/nix-shell) to store binaries of the
built packages. Install it as described in its [docs](https://docs.cachix.org/)
and then add the cache using `cachix use nix-shell` if you want to avoid
building those PHP packages yourself.

```shell
cachix use nix-shell
cachix use php-src-nix
```

This project also provides a basic template for PHP projects, to use it, run:

```shell
nix flake init --template github:loophp/nix-shell#basic
```

## Usage

While being extremely stable for years, "[flake][nix flake]" is an upcoming
feature of the Nix package manager. In order to use it, you must explicitly
enable it, please check the documentation to enable it, this is currently an
opt-in option.

### In a shell

To work with PHP 8.1 only:

```shell
nix shell github:loophp/nix-shell#php81
```

or with PHP 8.1 and a couple of useful tools:

```shell
nix shell github:loophp/nix-shell#env-php81
```

Since the 14th of November 2022, PHP is in `NTS` mode by default (see
[#154774](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/154774)).

To list the available PHP versions and environments, run:

  ```shell
  nix flake show github:loophp/nix-shell
  ```

### In another flake

<details>

<summary>Step 1</summary>

Import the input:

```nix
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    phps.url = "github:loophp/nix-shell";
  };
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Step 2</summary>

Import the overlay:

```nix
pkgs = import inputs.nixpkgs {
    inherit system;
    overlays = [
        inputs.phps.overlays.default
    ];
};
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Step 3</summary>

Use the packages:

```nix
    # PHP 8.1 environment
    pkgs.env-php81
```

</details>

To create your own version of PHP, use the available API function `buildPhpFromComposer`.

### With direnv

`direnv` is an extension for your shell. It augments existing shells with a new
feature that can load and unload environment variables depending on the current
directory. You can use it within Nix ([nix-direnv][nix direnv]) and load a
development environment just by changing directory.

Edit the file `.envrc` and add the following line:

```
use flake github:loophp/nix-shell#env-php-master-snapshot --impure
```

And it's done.

### Customize PHP

To customize the PHP configuration, you can do it like this:

```shell
nix shell github:loophp/nix-shell#php81
php -c /path/to/the/config.ini <<command>>
```

[Another option][doc .user.ini] would be to create a `.user.ini` file within
your current working directory before running the PHP environment, as such:

```ini
max_execution_time = 0
memory_limit = 2048M
```

Then run:

```shell
nix shell github:loophp/nix-shell#php82 --impure
```

The `--impure` flag is important to make sure that your custom
`.user.ini` file is correctly taken in account.
